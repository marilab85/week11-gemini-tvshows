For this week's assignment, I tried to create something usegul (I use that question a lot - When is this show returning?).
I also used my own brand pallete, to try to foccus on the branding side.

It was particularly hard, because I should have already watched the classes from week 09 that I missed, and the API integration was thought back then.
I had loads of help from Bertie in the drop inn session, but I still feell I'm behind.

Will catch up to have everything ready for the final week.

MAny thanks,
Marina
